# intro:

code for my Master's thesis project completed at UZH Psychiatric Hospital. the goal was to examine hippocampal and amygdalar oscillations during [fear conditioning](https://www.nature.com/subjects/fear-conditioning) in human [iEEG recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocorticography). 

# uses:
code uses SPM functions and custom scripts. patient data is protected by guidelines so it could not be released.
